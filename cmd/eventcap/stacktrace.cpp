 * execution daemon, most of the work is done by Boost.Stacktrace.
 *
 * Although there is little harm in taking this dependency ourselves, third
 * party users of the SDK may not want to use this library. If they use an
 * SDK function which asserts, they will will need to provide this symbol
 * to the linker. This file serves as an example of how to do this, using
 * the C++23 <stacktrace>
