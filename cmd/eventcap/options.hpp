/**
 * @file
 *
 * The eventcap utility is configured via CLI11 subcommands, each of which
 * populates an instance of a "command options" structure that captures the
 * inputs for an operation.
 *
 * Common fields in command options structures include:
 *
 *   - `event_source_spec` specifies the source of events to operate on
 *
 *  - `thread` specifies which thread to run on
 *
 *  - `output_spec` specifies an output file, which will be `stdout` if it is
 *    blank or the value `-`
 *
 * Command options structures represent raw input from CLI11 and not much input
 * validation has been performed on them. They will be analyzed for validity
 * when a formal `Command` structure is created for them (see eventcap.hpp).
