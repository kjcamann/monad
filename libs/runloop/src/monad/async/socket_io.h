As io_uring is currently incapable of doing listening socket setup by itself,
there is an explicit step for transferring the configured socket to io_uring
as it is an expensive operation.

Newer Linux kernels have an io_uring capable of connecting socket setup and
creation entirely within io_uring. If your kernel is so capable, that is used,
else blocking syscalls are used and the socket transferred into io_uring.

When this call returns, all syscall-created resources are released and io_uring
exclusively manages the socket.

If the executor was so configured, this API has io_uring allocate the buffer
which is more efficient than the application saying which buffer to fill. Upon
completion, `tofill->iovecs[0]` will be the buffer filled with up to `max_bytes`
(though it can be less). When you are done with the buffer, release it back to
io_uring using `monad_async_task_release_registered_io_buffer()`.
If this operation gets a result failure comparing equivalent to `ENOBUFS`,
then io_uring ran out of buffers to allocate. You should increase
`small_kernel_allocated_count` et al in `struct monad_async_executor_attr`.

If the executor was not configured with `small_kernel_allocated_count` et al,
then lack of i/o buffers will cause suspension of the calling task until i/o
buffers are released. You must still release buffers filled back to
io_uring using `monad_async_task_release_registered_io_buffer()`

`max_bytes` chooses whether to use large or small page sized buffers and the
actual bytes read does not affect the size of buffer chosen.

\warning io_uring **requires** that the contents of `tofill` and everything it
points at have lifetime until the read completes.
