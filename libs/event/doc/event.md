# The `monad` execution event system

The `monad` execution daemon includes a system for recording events that
occur during transaction processing. An event is something such as "an
account balance has been updated" or "a new block has started executing."
`monad` events can be observed by external third-party applications,
using a high-performance inter-process communication channel.

## Overview of events

There are two parts to the event system:

1. The `monad` execution daemon is the *writer* of all events
2. An external application can become a *reader* of events using the C
   library `libmonad_event`, whose implementation is in the same directory
   as this file

This documentation file provides a general overview of the event system,
and describes how to use `libmonad_event` as a reader.

### Basic operation

#### What is an event?

Events are made up of two components:

1. The *event descriptor* is a fixed-size (currently 64 byte) object
   describing an event that has happened. It contains the event's type,
   a sequence number, and a timestamp.
2. The *event payload* is a variably-sized piece of extra data about
   the event, which is specific to the event type. For example,
   a "start of transaction" event contains the Ethereum transaction
   information as its payload. Some of the fields in the event descriptor
   not already mentioned are used to communicate where in shared memory
   the payload bytes are located, and the payload's length.

#### Where do events live?

When an event occurs, `monad` inserts an event descriptor into a ring
buffer that lives in a shared memory segment. Event payloads are stored
in an array (in that same shared memory segment) called the "payload
buffer." The diagram below illustrates the memory layout:

   ╚═Payload buffer════════════════════════...═════════════════════════════════╝
```

Although there are two different ring buffers in this system -- the descriptor
array and payload buffer -- the entire combined data structure is called the
"event ring."

A few properties about the style of communication chosen:

- It supports _broadcast_ semantics: multiple readers may read from the event
  ring simultaneously, and each reader maintains its own iterator position
  within the ring

- As in typical broadcast protocols, the writer is not aware of the readers --
  events are written regardless of whether anyone is reading them or not. This
  implies that the writer cannot wait for a reader if it is slow. Readers must
  iterate through events quickly, or they will be lost: descriptor and payload
  memory can be overwritten by later events. Conceptually the event series
  is a *queue* (it has FIFO semantics) but is usually called a *ring* to
  emphasize these overwrite-upon-overflow semantics

- A sequence number is included in the event descriptor to detect gaps
  (missing events due to slow readers), and a similar strategy is used to
  detect payload buffer contents are overwritten

#### An example event and payload

Each kind of event is identified by a C enumeration constant in the
`enum monad_event_type` type, in `event_types.h`.

One particularly important event is `MONAD_EVENT_TXN_START`, which is written
by `monad` as soon as a new transaction begins executing within the EVM. It
contains the transaction information (encoded as a C structure) as its event
payload. This structure is also defined in `event_types.h` and its definition
appears below:

```c
/// Event payload for MONAD_EVENT_TXN_START
struct monad_event_txn_header
{
    monad_event_bytes32 tx_hash;
    uint64_t nonce;
    uint64_t gas_limit;
    monad_event_uint256_ne max_fee_per_gas;
    monad_event_uint256_ne max_priority_fee_per_gas;
    monad_event_uint256_ne value;
    monad_event_address from;
    monad_event_address to;
    uint8_t txn_type;
    monad_event_uint256_ne r;
    monad_event_uint256_ne s;
    uint8_t y_parity;
    monad_event_uint256_ne chain_id;
    uint32_t data_length;
};
```

The transaction's variably-size `data`, whose length is specified by the
`data_length` field, is also part of the event payload and immediately
follows this structure.

Note that the transaction number is not included in the payload structure.
Because of their importance in the monad blockchain protocol, transaction
numbers are encoded directly in the event descriptor (this is described
later in the documentation).

All the C enumeration constants start with a `MONAD_EVENT_` prefix, but
typically the documentation refers to event types without the prefix, i.e.,
`TXN_START` instead of `MONAD_EVENT_TXN_START`. In other language bindings
these may be named using the languages scoping rules instead, e.g., in Rust
this event is `monad_event_type::TXN_START`.

#### Ring database (or "ring db")

There is more than one kind of event ring: the standard execution events
are recorded to one event ring, and the performance tracer (which has more
overhead, and can be turned off) is a separate event ring. The API that
imports an event ring accepts this enumeration constant to specify which
ring to operate on:

```c
enum monad_event_ring_type : uint8_t
{
    MONAD_EVENT_RING_EXEC,  ///< Core execution events
    MONAD_EVENT_RING_TRACE, ///< Performance tracing events
    MONAD_EVENT_RING_COUNT, ///< Number of recognized ring types
};
```

The execution daemon maintains a publicly-accessible shared memory object
called the event ring database (or "ring db"). This is a small
shared-memory-resident data structure describing which event rings are
currently available. Most importantly, the ring db contains the information
needed to `mmap(2)` the shared memory segment of the event ring into an
external process' address space.

The ring db is a POSIX-style shared memory object (see `man shm_open`) so
it is identified by a unique name. In Linux, POSIX shared memory objects
also appear as a file in the `/dev/shm` directory. The execution daemon
automatically creates the ring db when it is started. In our event API,
the caller typically passes `nullptr` as the name of the ring db shared
memory object, which will select the default value used by the execution
daemon.

## Client API overview

### Core concepts

The three central objects in the API, which are generally used in the order
they are listed, are:

1. __monad_event_ring_db__ - represents an open handle to the ring db owned by
   a running `monad` execution process; the primary thing the user does with
   this object is import event rings from it, using the
   `monad_event_ring_db_import` function
2. __monad_event_ring__ - represents an event ring whose shared memory
   segments have been mapped into the address space of the current process;
   the primary thing the client does with this object is use it to initialize
   iterators that point into the event ring, using the
   `monad_event_iterator_init` function
3. __monad_event_iterator__ - the star of the show: this iterator object is
   used to actually read events. It offers both zero-copy and memcpy style
   APIs (zero copy APIs are explained in detail later in the documentation)

The easiest way to understand the API is to compile and run the included
`eventwatch` example program. After watching it run for a little while (you
will need to be running a `monad` execution process at the same time), just
read the code.

### Using the API in your project

Because it is designed for third party integration, `libmonad_event` does
not depend on anything else in the `monad` git repository and this entire
directory's contents may be copied into your own codebase. A Rust client
library is also available, in another repository.

Both libraries include a mechanism for detecting if your local copy becomes
out-of-date vs. the running execution daemon. For example, suppose you
upgrade the execution daemon to a new version, and in this new version the
definition of the `TXN_START` payload has changed. Further suppose that you
forget to copy the new `event_types.h` and recompile your program. In this
case, the API call which opens the ring db will fail gracefully with the
`EPROTO` errno code ("Protocol error").

### Ring DB APIs

API | Purpose
--- | -------
`monad_event_ring_db_open` | Open a handle to the shared memory file describing which event rings are available
`monad_event_ring_db_close` | Close an open ring db handle obtained from `monad_event_ring_db_open`
`monad_event_ring_db_is_alive` | Return true if the execution daemon associated with the ring db is still alive
`monad_event_ring_db_import` | Import an `monad_event_ring` into the current process, using metadata from the ring db
`monad_event_ring_db_get_last_error` | Return a human-readable string describing the last error that occured on this thread

All functions which fail return an `errno(3)` domain error code diagnosing
the reason for failure. The function `monad_event_ring_db_get_last_error` is
used to provide a human-readable string explanation of what failed.

### Event Iterator APIs

API | Purpose
--- | -------
`monad_event_iterator_try_next` | If the next event descriptor if is available, copy it and advance the iterator
`monad_event_iterator_try_copy_all` | Copy both the event descriptor and payload as one atomic operation; easiest API to use, but see the zero copy API section
`monad_event_iterator_reset` | Reset the iterator to point to the most recently produced event descriptor; used for gap recovery

### Event Payload APIs

API | Purpose
--- |--------
`monad_event_payload_peek` | Get a zero-copy pointer to an event payload
`monad_event_payload_check` | Check if an event payload refered to by a zero-copy pointer has been overwritten
`monad_event_payload_memcpy` | `memcpy` the event payload to a buffer, succeeding only if the payload copy is valid

The simplest API is `monad_event_iterator_try_copy_all`, which copies both
the descriptor and payload, performs all validity checking, and advances the
iterator if successful. However, the user must take care to provide a large
enough buffer to hold any possible payload or the copied payload may be
truncated. For example, here is some code which will not work because the
buffer is too small:

```c
void read_events(struct monad_iterator_reader *iter) {
    struct monad_event_descriptor event;
    uint8_t tiny_buf[64]; // This payload buffer is too small for most events

    switch (monad_event_iterator_try_copy_all(iter, &event, tiny_buf, sizeof tiny_buf)) {
    case MONAD_EVENT_SUCCESS:
        if (event.length > sizeof tiny_buf) {
            // Event payload has more data than could fit in our buffer, so we're
            // missing part of it. A size of 64 is far too small for many event
            // payloads (e.g., BLOCK_START) so this is guaranteed to happen almost
            // immediately.
            fprintf(stderr, "truncated event! saw large event with size: %u\n",
                    event.length);
            abort();
        } else {
            do_something_with_event(&event, tiny_buf);
        }
        break;

    case MONAD_EVENT_PAYLOAD_EXPIRED:
        [[fallthrough]];
    case MONAD_EVENT_GAP:
        /* ... gap or expired payload, handle it */

    case MONAD_EVENT_NOT_READY:
        break; // Nothing ready, we're done
    }
}
```

### Library organization

The files in `libmonad_event` are:

File | Contains
---- | ----
`event.h` | Definitions of core shared memory structures for event rings
`event_metadata.h` | Structures that describe event metadata (string names of events, etc.)
`event_metadata.c` | Static data definition of all event metadata; generated code
`event_iterator.h` | Defines the basic event iterator object and its API
`event_iterator_inline.h` | Definitions of the `event_iterator.h` functions, all of which are inlined for performance reasons
`event_ring_db.h` | API for opening the list of available event rings in the execution daemon and importing their shared memory
`event_ring_db.c` | Implementation of the `event_ring_db.h` interface
`event_types.h` | Definition of the `monad_event_type` enumeration and all payload structures; generated code

Some other files in this same directory are:

File | Contents
---- | --------

`event_test_util.c` | Implementation of `event_test_util.h`
`example/eventwatch.c` | A sample program that shows how to use the API

## Event lifetimes, gap detection, and zero copy APIs

### Sequence numbers and the lifetime detection algorithm

All event descriptors are tagged with an incrementing sequence number
starting at 1. Sequence numbers are 64-bit unsigned integers which never
repeat. Zero is not valid sequence number.

Also note that the sequence number modulo the ring buffer size equals the
ring buffer index where the *next* event wil be located. This is shown
below with a concrete example where the ring buffer size is 64. Note that
the last valid index in the array is 63, then access wraps around to the
beginning of the array at index 0.

```

          idx 61        idx  62       idx  63       idx 0
------.-------------.-------------.-------------.-------------.-----
      | Event       | Event       | Event       | Event       |
 ...  |  seqno 318  |  seqno 319  |  seqno 320  |  seqno 256  |  ...
      |             |             |             |             |
------.-------------.-------------.-------------.-------------.-----
                         ^
                         Next event

last seen sequence number (last_seqno) is initially 318
```

In this example:

- We keep track of the "last seen sequence number" (`last_seqno`) which has
  value `318` to start; being the "last" sequence number means we have already
  finished reading the event with this sequence number, which lives at array
  index `61`

- `318 % 64` is `62`, so we will find the potential next event at that index
  *if* it has been produced

- Observe that the sequence number of the item at index `62` is `319`, which
  is the last seen sequence number plus 1 (`319 == 318 + 1`). This means that
  event `319` has been produced, and its data can be safely read from that
  slot

- When we're ready to advance to the next event, the last seen sequence
  number will be incremented to `319`. As before, we can find the *next*
  event (if it has been produced) at `319 % 64 == 63`. The event at this
  index bears the sequence number `320`, which is again the last seen
  sequence number + 1, therefore this event is also valid

- When advancing a second time, we increment the last seen sequence number
  to `320`. This time, the event at index `320 % 64 == 0` is *not* `321`,
  but is a smaller number, `256`. This means the next event has not been
  written yet, and we are seeing an older event in the same slot. We will
  need to check for a new event later

- Alternatively we might have seen a much larger sequence number, like
  `384` (`320 + 64`). This would mean that we consumed events too slowly, so
  slowly that (at least) the 63 events in the range `[321, 384)` were produced
  in the meantime. These were subsequently overwritten, and are now lost.
  There is no way to recover or replay them

### Lifetime of an event payload, zero copy vs. memcpy APIs

Because of the ring buffer overwrite behavior, an event descriptor might be
overwritten by the `monad` process while a reader is still examining its
data. To deal with this, the reader API makes a copy of the event descriptor.
If it detects that the event descriptor changed during the copy operation, it
reports a gap. Copying an event descriptor is fast, because it is only a
single cache line in size.

This is not the case for event payloads, which could potentially be very
large. This means a `memcpy(3)` of an event payload could be expensive, and
it would be advantageous to read the payload bytes directly from the shared
memory segment: a "zero-copy" API. This exposes the user to the possibility
that the event payload could be overwritten while still using it, so two
solutions are provided:

1. A simple detection mechanism allows payload overwrite to be detected at
   any time: the writer keeps track of the minimum payload offset value
   (_before_ modular arithmetic is applied) that is still valid. If the
   offset value in the event descriptor is smaller than this, it is no
   longer safe to read the event payload

2. A payload `memcpy`-style API is also provided. This uses the detection
   mechanism above in the following way: first, the payload is copied to
   a user-provided buffer. Before returning, it checks if the lifetime
   remained valid after the copy finished. If so, then an overwrite did not
   occur during the copy, so the copy must be valid. Otherwise, the copy is
   invalid

The reason to prefer the zero-copy APIs is that they do less work. The
reason to prefer memcpy APIs is that it is not always easy (or possible) to
"undo" the work you did if you find out later that the event payload was
corrupted by an overwrite while you were working with it. The most logical
thing to do in that case is start by copying the data to stable location,
and if the copy isn't valid, to never start the operation.

An example user of the zero-copy API is the `eventwatch` example program,
which can turn events into printed strings that are sent to `stdout`. The
expensive work of formatting a hexdump of the event payload is performed
using the original payload memory. If an overwrite happened during the
string formatting, the hexdump output buffer will be wrong, but that is OK:
it will not be sent to `stdout` until the end. Once formatting is complete,
`eventwatch` checks if the payload expired and if so, writes an error to
`stderr` instead of writing the formatted buffer to `stdout`.

Whether you should copy or not depends on the characteristics of the reader,
namely how easily it can deal with "aborting" processing.

## Event descriptors in detail

### Binary format

The event descriptor is defined this way:

```c
struct monad_event_descriptor
{
    alignas(64) uint64_t seqno;  ///< Sequence number, for gap/liveness check
    enum monad_event_type type;  ///< What kind of event this is
    uint16_t block_flow_id;      ///< ID representing block exec header
    uint8_t source_id;           ///< ID representing origin thread
    bool pop_scope;              ///< Ends the trace scope of an event
    bool inline_payload;         ///< True -> payload is stored inline
    uint8_t : 8;                 ///< Unused tail padding
    uint32_t length;             ///< Size of event payload
    uint32_t txn_id;             ///< 0 == no txn, else ID == txn num + 1
    uint64_t epoch_nanos;        ///< Time event was recorded
    union
    {
        uint64_t payload_buf_offset; ///< Payload buffer byte offset
        uint8_t payload[32];         ///< Payload contents if inline_payload
    };
};
```

### Other fields in `struct monad_event_descriptor`

The fields which have not been described yet are `pop_scope`, `source_id`,
`block_flow_id`, `txn_id`, `inline_payload`, and the fixed-size `payload`
array.

If `inline_payload` is true, the payload is stored directly in the
`payload` array inside the descriptor itself, rather than in the payload
buffer. In this case, `payload_buf_offset` is not valid (its space is
reused by the payload buffer) and the payload never expires.

`pop_scope` is used by the performance tracer to express that the
nearest-enclosing tracing scope is terminated by this event. It has no
meaning outside the performance tracer, see the `tracer.md` document for
more information.

The `source_id` field is used to represent which thread recorded an event,
which is needed for the performance tracer. `block_flow_id` does something
similar, associating all events that are part of block execution with that
block. The two IDs have similar properties:

1. They are both a kind of compression strategy. A Linux system thread ID
   is 32 bits, but in practice only a very small number of values occur
   over and over again. It is critical that `struct monad_event_descriptor`
   remain as small as possible for performance reasons, so a system thread ID
   is mapped to a smaller range and that is used instead. The situation for
   a block is similar: although a single block number requires 64 bits,
   `monad` executes *proposed* blocks, so there isn't just one linear block
   number, but a block header whose size is much larger than the event
   descriptor itself. The only way to efficiently represent it in the event
   is to use the same trick. Since there are obviously more than 4095
   blocks in a typical `monad` run, the IDs are recycled. In both cases,
   zero is not valid ID.

2. The maximum values of `source_id` and `block_flow_id` are relatively small
   (255 and 4095, respectively), so it is cheap to look up extra data 
   associated with threads or blocks by using the ID as an array index.

3. The "cheap array index" property is used by the event system itself.
   Source IDs and block flow IDs are defined by the `THREAD_CREATE` and 
   `BLOCK_START` events, respectively. The payload for `THREAD_CREATE`
   describes the thread metadata, and the payload for `BLOCK_START` describes
   the pre-execution block header. Like all event payloads, these are copied
   to the payload buffer, but they are also stored in arrays, in a special
   shared memory segment called the "ring db." These two arrays are accessible
   to the caller in the `monad_event_ring_db_data` object. The reason for this
   is that if the reader joins "late" (or resets after a gap), they might miss
   the original event that announced the creation of a thread or the start of
   a block, but might still want to know this information since subsequent
   events still refer to these objects. Keeping the metadata around and
   accessible makes it easy for the reader to look up thread and block metadata
   at any time, via an array access. For an example of how these are used,
   check how the `eventwatch` sample program prints the name of the thread
   that recorded an event.

The `txn_id` field associates an event with the transaction that produced it.
A value of zero indicates that the event is not associated with any
transaction, e.g., the `BLOCK_START` event. A non-zero ID satisfies
`id == <transaction-index> + 1`, i.e., subtracting one from the ID gives
the zero-based index of the transaction within the block.

Storing the transaction ID in the descriptor allows the reader to easily
filter the large number of transaction events. For example, upon seeing the
transaction header (the `TXN_START` event payload), a reader may decide that
a transaction is interesting. Keeping the `txn_id` in the descriptor of all
subsequent events for that transaction makes it more efficient to examine
only the interesting ones (e.g., `TXN_LOG` events), as there is no need to
look at the event payload for uninteresting IDs.
