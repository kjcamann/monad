// replacement for evmc's `evmc_storage_status`: the enumerators mirror
// `evmc_storage_status` 1:1 (same underlying integer values), which keeps the
// gas/refund table lookups in store_cost numerically unchanged. The 1:1
// correspondence is enforced by static_assert in storage_status.cpp.
//
// The enum itself carries no evmc dependency. The only tie to evmc is the
// conversion functions below, which are needed solely at the remaining evmc
// host interface boundary (the EvmcHost overrides, whose signatures are fixed
// by evmc::HostInterface); they — together with the <evmc/evmc.h> include — are
// removable in one step once the host interface is ported off evmc.
