/**
 * @file
 *
 * This file defines iterator helpers for execution event rings. They are used
 * to efficiently rewind iterators for block-oriented replay, i.e., when the
 * user wants to replay whole blocks (and block consensus events) for old
 * events that are still resident in event ring memory.
 *
 * Note that in the documentation, `BLOCK_START` is considered a "consensus
 * event" because it represents the first state transition (to "proposed")
