/* \brief Makes available the lowest possible latency zoned storage, if `zonefs`
is available. Otherwise falls back to an emulation which can use a file on a
filesystem, or a block device.

\todo Actually implement `zonefs` support.

Linux `zonefs` when mounted exposes the NVMe zone namespaces as a POSIX
directory hierarchy. There are two directories in the root:

1. `cnv`, whose contents are all the conventional zones configured on the
storage device. Conventional zones can be read-write modified at will. These
have the block device emulation layer implemented by the storage device, and
thus reads from them have conventional SSD latencies e.g. 70 microseconds.

2. `seq`, whose contents are all the append-only zones configured on the storage
device. Sequential write zones can only be appended to for writes, and once
appended to, nothing already written can be modified. Read from these zones
bypass the block device emulation layer, and thus latencies are very
significantly improved e.g. 15-30 microseconds. Sequential write zones can be
recycled on request, all their contents are disposed of in a single operation
(this corresponds to NAND flash block erase), after which they can be
sequentially written into again.

You can read more about Linux `zonefs` at
https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/zonefs.html.

This class is a thin wrapper around Linux `zonefs` if it is fed filesystem
paths to `zonefs` mounts. If it is fed a raw partition or a file on a
filesystem, it chops up that space into 256Mb chunks and exposes those as a
single conventional zone, and the remainder as sequential write zones. The
semantics are correctly emulated: resetting a chunk sends through a TRIM command
to the underlying storage, this will cause filesystems to truly deallocate
storage and raw partitions to issue a TRIM command to their hardware. This in
turn prevents garbage collection i/o storms caused by SSDs initiating forced
background TRIM during normal i/o to free up blocks, which introduces
pathological i/o performance loss at usually the most inconvenient times.
